# Student-Management-System

Simple Student Management System project to manage student data, course enrollment and grading

Reworked on the Java Assessment which I had during my bootcamp to familiarize with concepts of OOP and make further improvements. Further things to work on:

1. Update regex to validate email inputs for spaces during student registration.
2. Include failed courses option (branched) within selection in Option 7.
3. Option to add new courses to module. Option to add instructors with relationship to course.
4. Expanding this into a Full-Stack project with UI and security features.
5. Refactoring required for 3 layer design.

Things that I tried (hopefully) to improve on:

1. Refactored repetitive blocks with functions.
2. Use a more declarative approach in writing.
